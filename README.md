This is a collection of our Juju presentations to conferences over the years. 

## Organization


### deck.js

These are the bulk of Jorge and Marco's slides, they are in HTML format using the excellent [deck.js framework](http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/). Feel free to mix and match slides, and organize your talk in it's own folder.

### traditional_slides

These are for more traditional slides like PDFs and LibreOffice. If you're uncomfortable editing the HTML slides then feel free to toss in your decks in here.
