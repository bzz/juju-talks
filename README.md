# Juju Presentations

This is a collection of our Juju presentations to conferences over the years. Anyone in the community is welcome to submit presentations into this repository.

## Organization

### deck.js

These are the bulk of Jorge and Marco's older slides, they are in HTML format using the excellent [deck.js framework](http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/). Feel free to mix and match slides, and organize your talk in it's own folder. Much of the content from this folder is now out of date with both technology and terminology, so tread lightly. 

### traditional_slides

These are for more traditional slides like PDFs and LibreOffice. If you're uncomfortable editing the HTML slides then feel free to toss in your decks in here.

### Topics and Titles

Look in here for topic, titles, and other ideas on how to make a good Juju presentation. 

### Online presentations

Some slides are online only.  The [Prezi](http://prezi.com) framework allows slides transitions to zoom on a larger canvas.
