# The future of datacenter orchestration: realizing service oriented architecture.

In the early days of datacenter management, administrators used shell scripts to automate repeated setup and configuration instructions across multiple machines. This didnâ€™t scale well, as changes needed to be made gradually and keep the configuration versioned. If a particular change failed in production, it required man hours to unwind that change as well, which is expensive. These factors provided the keystone movement for configuration management technologies to step in. 

As our deployments become more complex and the need for scale out computing increases, there is a clear need for adopting the habits of Service Oriented Architecture, that leverages configuration management principals focused on workloads.  This is a gateway to roll out gradual, versioned, and repeatable changes against services provided in any network. Which promotes services as the first class citizens, and keeps the machine a necessary second.

Service Orchestration is the evolution of datacenter management as we know it today.
