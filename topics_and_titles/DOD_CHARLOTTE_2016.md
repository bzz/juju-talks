# Ideas

Continuous Delivery at Canonical ( Using Mojo to keep away bad Juju )

Containers at Canonical (Juju, Kubernetes, Docker)


## Containers all the way down

In this talk we’ll cover the building blocks of modern containers (from chroot to AuFS). The primary differences between LXC and Docker, (or app containers vs system containers) and dive into the many new “DataCenter OS” tools like Kubernetes. 

At Canonical we have been watching the Container story emerge, leading in the system container space, and participating in the “Make this accessible to anyone who wants to try it” sphere. We will share our knowledge of running containers in production, introduce the challenges we faced and how we’ve got you covered when you’re ready to head to production with your container tech of choice.
