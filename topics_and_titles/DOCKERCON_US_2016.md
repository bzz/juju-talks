# Modeling Telco Grade 5G Networks in Docker

Mobile networks have to be bulletproof and reliable. The telecommunications 
industry is riddled with special use case hardware and legacy infrastructure
that is getting the upgrade to being virtualized aka 5G. Let's explore what your 
cellphones 4G LTE network looks like when modeled, and how this project went
from zero to full throttle under 30 days.


### Topics:
- Using docker with software defined networking at scale, in the cloud,
to provide device level networks 
- Understanding the problem
- Moving from physical to virtual
- Delivering the virtual appliance repeatedly and reliably
- Instant collaboration with multiple vendors due to abstracting the ‘relations’
