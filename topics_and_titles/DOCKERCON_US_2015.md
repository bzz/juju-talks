# Automated Invasion

### Abstract:  

Some of the biggest security vulnerabilities were found and published in 2014, so much that linux was labeled the most vulnerable OS! Who remembers going through some several hundred servers checking for package versions and ensuring the proper patches were indeed fixed/landed? Why isn’t automating this a core part of all release pipelines, and where’s the automated tools to ensure the script kiddies of the world aren’t pwning our target rich environment?

Leveraging the ease of the juju relationship model, and docker to distribute tooling and configuration - we’re going to break a few things and audit for a safer approach to releasing software and infrastructure.
